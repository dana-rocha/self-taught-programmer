# Write a program that prints a message if a variable is less than or equal to 10, another
# message if the variable is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 25, and another message
# if the variable is greater than 25


x = 33

if (x <= 10):
    print("It's less!")
elif (x > 10 and x <= 25):
    print("It's in between!")

    print("It's a large number!")
